          A nostalgic dive into the golden age of gaming, <strong>Bryan's Arcade</strong> is a curated collection of four old-school arcade games, reimagined with modern web technologies.
          Each game was handcrafted to capture the spirit of classic 80s and 90s gameplay—simple mechanics, fast-paced action, and pixel-perfect aesthetics.
          <br/><br/>
          This project highlights my love for both software development and gaming history. It challenged me to balance design fidelity with responsive, performant code using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
          More than a tribute, Bryan’s Arcade is a demonstration of how thoughtful development can preserve the joy of retro games in a modern digital experience.
